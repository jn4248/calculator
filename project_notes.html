/////////////    FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES - IMPORTANT  ///////////////////////
display update:
- limit number of digits you can enter (cur.length < someNumber)
- remove 0 before adding new numbers.
- don't let SIGN change 0 to -0
- keep zero if first digit is Decimal point (eg:  0.3984 and not .3984)




why are functions like this automatically running? preventDevault or Propagation from another function?
  keyDivide.addEventListener('click', operation("DIVIDE")

keep track of resetting newString as "0" or "" and then have update display control, or formate handle taking "" or "0." and displaying it as "0"

set html display to 0, and have reset go back to "0"?

redo storing numbers and strings in arrays, instead of dealing with strings?
- may be easier to remove and insert symbols....
splice(pos, n) ...remove n items starting at position pos
unshift(x) add to front of arrays
shift() remove first item in arrays
includes
indexOf (or find()) finds 1st index of 'x' is -1 if not found
join() combines all items into a string
some() - returns true if at least one element sataifes the testing function





numStringUnderMaxLength() : check is being made before actually adding the current digit, so here if I'm trying to add the 10th digit, it's only analying the "previous" numString that has 9 digits, instead of checking the length of the numString I'm trying to create NOW that is 10 digits.....so, It' allows me to do 10 digits even though says < MaxLength (=10)
